# Welcome to the Data Science, AI & Art Portfolio 👋

## About Me 🚀

I’m U Ashay Thamankar, a Data Scientist passionate about transforming data into actionable insights through forecasting, analytics, and automation.
I focus on demand forecasting, machine learning, deep learning and Azure-based data pipelines, and I also explore Generative AI, end-to-end ML deployment, and creative coding solutions.

Beyond data science, I’m deeply passionate about Madhubani painting, Yakshagana folk dance, and traditional Indian art forms that balance analytical precision with creativity.
