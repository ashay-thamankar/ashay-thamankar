Welcome to My Data Analysis and Coding Projects!
ðŸ‘‹ I'm U Ashay Thamankar, and this is where I share my diverse collection of projects. With a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering and a strong foundation in various subjects, I've ventured into data analysis using Python, mastered SQL, and harnessed the power of Power BI. My data analysis journey extends to Python libraries, and I'm also exploring the world of Flutter app development.

ðŸ’» I'm passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. From Python data analysis to SQL data manipulation, and even creating Flutter apps, I'm excited to showcase my work.

ðŸ“ˆ With a solid understanding of statistics for data science and a flair for storytelling through data, I've also included some interesting anecdotes.
